Part 1 Imaging Technique Inspiration
Chosen Imaging Technique：
Using color depth, graphic symmetry, and atmosphere
Illustrative Images:
1. <img width="173" alt="image" src="https://github.com/mimixiatia/readme.md/assets/145733188/eb430f72-885d-4446-85ea-472329464abc">

Analysis：
These three images highlight various imaging techniques that resonate emotionally with the viewer. The first uses highly saturated colors to add a sense of fantasy to the building. The second provides an overhead perspective that emphasizes geometric forms and regular arrangements, highlighting the importance of composition. The third one conveys the relationship between stillness and movement, demonstrating the connection between environment and emotion. My project aims to be visually compelling and emotionally resonant through these techniques.

Part2
Selected Coding Technique：
Shader Programming
Discussion：
1. Color Gradients and Depth: Use the Fragment Shader to apply gradients to each pixel of an image, changing its color or brightness based on its position in the image or in relation to other objects.
2. Geometry and Symmetry: Use the Vertex Shader to create and manipulate basic geometric shapes such as triangles, rectangles, or circles to form complex patterns and symmetrical structures.
3. Ambience and Texture: Combine two shader types to enhance the ambiance of an image using texture mapping or ambient lighting techniques.
